Current text:
My interest in coding didn't begin right away; rather, after years of playing videogames, I became curious on how software development works. As a result, I learned about the world of programming and how much you can
accomplish with it. I dove into Python, teaching myself by watching
videos, reading forums, and trying to make my own mini projects. As
artificial intelligence rapidly progressed, I began to utilize it in various projects, having it oversee code that I wasn't familiar with yet.

As of now, I do believe I'm still a novice programmer. However, the progress that I've gained even in the last few months keeps me determined to learn more. While I have the basics of Python down, I am also learning a bit of HTML, so I can more effectively proofread the AI I use to create websites.
