## Adding More Projects

To add additional projects, copy the "Project Template" section above and fill in the details. Projects will be displayed in a grid layout.

## Notes

- Images should be stored in `assets/images/project_covers/`

- For comparison images (side-by-side), you can use the comparison layout format
- Each project card can optionally include a "Live Demo" link in addition to GitHub
