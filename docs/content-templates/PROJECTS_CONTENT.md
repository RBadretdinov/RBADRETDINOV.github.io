Current: Custom Macro - Auto Clicker
```

**Description:**
```
[Write your project description here...]

Current text:
A Python GUI application developed to assist with automating repetitive mouse clicking tasks, originally created for a friend of mine to help maintain user presence during idle periods in videogames and other applications. Features an intuitive interface with Start/Stop controls and status indicators, allowing users to configure automatic left mouse clicks at random intervals. The click interval can be customized by the user or defaults to a random range between 7-15 seconds, providing a helpful solution for users who need to maintain activity without manual intervention.

### Project 2

**Title:**
```
[Project title here...]

Current: PNGs to PDF Converter
```

**Description:**
```
[Write your project description here...]

Current text:
This is a Python command-line tool designed to convert multiple image files (PNG, JPG, JPEG) into a single 
multi-page PDF document, or merge multiple existing PDF files into one. Useful for creating PDFs from 
photo collections, streamlining scanning workflows, or combining document files. Supports directory 
scanning and automatic image format conversion to RGB for compatibility. While its core function is simple, the program was extremely useful because I had originally created it to help submit my high school assignments. Seeing as other PDF converters weren't free, I decided to make my own.
```

**Technologies:**
```

A web application currently in development that enables users to create, customize, and share interactive quizzes. This is my first huge project that I'm managing with AI; by leveraging AI tools for planning, debugging, and implementation, I'm learning modern development practices while building a useful application. The application will feature an intuitive interface for building questions with multiple choice options, 
automatic scoring, and quiz sharing capabilities. Originally designed to assist me with studying for exams, this can be a versatile tool for educators, students,
and anyone looking to create engaging quiz experiences.
