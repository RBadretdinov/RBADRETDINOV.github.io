                                        Much of the same topics were included in the 365 as it combined the previous problems. Though, it did reinforce my Word skills 
                                        so I'd be able to navigate the program quite efficiently.

                                        While completing this certification was a challenge, the complex formulas that it tested me over was really interesting. It reminded 
                                        me of coding because the user has to input the actual command to choose the correct formula.
